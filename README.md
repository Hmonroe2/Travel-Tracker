## Features
  - This application features a fully functional Travel Tracker. Users can see all the past,upcoming and Pending trips. A user can see the total they have spent for the year. A user can book a new trip with a date, destination, duration and amount of people. A user can get an estimate for a trip before booking. 
## Possible Future Extensions
  - Future extensions would allow the user to delete their past trips, and see total spent for different years. Another extension would be adding the flight and lodging cost to the cards for users to see exactly what they spent.

## Setup
After one person has gone through the steps of cloning down this repo and editing the remote, everyone should clone down the repo.

Then install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with the Turing logo image and a beautiful gradient background. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.
